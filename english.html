                        <h3>Defining Moment </h3>
                      <p>( For this project we had to pick something that defines us as a person, So I pick losing my grandma becuase she was my closet friend as you read my story you will see why it defines me as a person)</p>  <p>Have you ever lost someone who was close to you ? I lost my grandma february,9,2009 , it was so shocking to me because the day before she died we we sitting in her whitish room where we talked about my future and college. I always went to my grandma for advice. Me and my grandma basically talked everyday, I always went to her house after school my grandma always told me to keep her happy by doing good in school.
</p><p>So the next day , I went to school and as soon as I got out of school my mother was sad. I keep asking my mother what was wrong. she finally told me that my grandma had died from kidney failure. The moment when my mother told me my grandma was gone for good it felt like I lost everything, that moment everything was in slow motion, i was in a daze. I keep saying  “No NO No she can’t be gone , why did god take my closest friend away from me ?’’ knowing that my grandma wasn’t going to be able to see me graduate out of 8th grade even making it to college was so hard on me. Losing my grandma was a hard pill to swallow, but now I just pray for better days. I do things for both of us. 
</p><p>I know my grandma is looking down smiling at me saying “ that’s my baby do it for granny.’’ Now that my grandma is gone I be on my P&Q’s because that’s what My grandma wanted. Everyday I wake up I always say to myself “ today is going to be a good day’’, today i’m going to stay happy just for my grandma. Every time I think  of my grandma I don’t cry because i know my grandma wouldn’t want me crying. Losing my grandma change me a lot because now I feel whatever I  do reflects on my grandma because my grandma taught me good enough to not be disrespectful or even have a bad reputation on myself.

</p><p>A letter to my grandma , 
		It’s never a day i go without thinking about you. I always say to myself why did god take my closest friend away from me. I wish you were still here so we can finish having our moments where we laugh, played, and had talks. grandma i’m down here doing my best just for you. save a spot right next to you so we can finish where we left off at. I love you Granny i Can’t wait until i see you again. 
				
							Love always, your favorite Carribean
